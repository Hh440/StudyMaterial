# Subnetting and Supernetting in Computer Networks

## Subnetting
### Definition
Subnetting is the process of dividing a single network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets).

### Purpose
- Efficient IP address utilization.
- Enhancing security and isolating network traffic.
- Simplifying network management.
- Reducing broadcast traffic.

### How It Works
- A **subnet mask** is used to distinguish between the network portion and the host portion of an IP address.
- Example: A Class C network `192.168.1.0/24` can be divided into subnets like:
  - `192.168.1.0/26`
  - `192.168.1.64/26`
  - `192.168.1.128/26`
  - `192.168.1.192/26`

## Supernetting
### Definition
Supernetting is the process of combining multiple contiguous networks into a larger address space, typically to reduce the size of routing tables.

### Purpose
- Minimize the number of routes in a routing table (route aggregation).
- Optimize routing performance.

### How It Works
- A **supernet mask** (shorter than the default subnet mask) combines networks.
- Example: Two Class C networks `192.168.0.0/24` and `192.168.1.0/24` can be supernetted to `192.168.0.0/23`.

## IP Address Classes
IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E, determined by the first few bits of the IP address.

### Class A
- **Range**: `0.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.0.0.0` (/8)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Large networks.
  - 8 bits for the network portion, 24 bits for the host portion.
  - Supports ~16.7 million hosts.

### Class B
- **Range**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0` (/16)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Medium-sized networks.
  - 16 bits for the network portion, 16 bits for the host portion.
  - Supports ~65,000 hosts.

### Class C
- **Range**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0` (/24)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Small networks.
  - 24 bits for the network portion, 8 bits for the host portion.
  - Supports 254 hosts.

### Class D
- **Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
- **Purpose**: Reserved for multicast communication.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No subnetting.
  - Not for host assignments.

### Class E
- **Range**: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
- **Purpose**: Reserved for experimental and research purposes.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Not used in public networks.

## Subnet Mask and Prefix
- **Subnet Mask**: Indicates the split between the network and host portions in an IP address.
  - Example: `255.255.255.0` corresponds to a prefix length of `/24`.
- **CIDR Notation**: Classless Inter-Domain Routing uses prefix notation (e.g., `/24`).
  - Represents the number of bits in the network portion.

## Subnetting and Supernetting Example

### Subnetting Example
- **Original Network**: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Subnets**:
  - `192.168.1.0/26` (64 IPs)
  - `192.168.1.64/26` (64 IPs)
  - `192.168.1.128/26` (64 IPs)
  - `192.168.1.192/26` (64 IPs)

### Supernetting Example
- **Original Networks**: `192.168.0.0/24` and `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Combined Supernet**: `192.168.0.0/23` (512 IPs)

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Subnetting                      | Supernetting                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Objective**    | Divide a network into smaller subnets. | Combine multiple networks into a larger one. |
| **Mask Length**  | Increases (e.g., `/24` → `/26`) | Decreases (e.g., `/24` → `/23`) |
| **Purpose**      | Manageability, security, isolation. | Route aggregation, reduce routing tables. |
