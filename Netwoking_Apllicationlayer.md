# Application Layer Protocols

The **Application Layer** is the topmost layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It provides several ways to manipulate data, enabling any type of user to access the network. This layer interacts directly with the application, providing common web application services. In this article, we’ll discuss various application layer protocols, which facilitate communication and data sharing between software applications on different network devices.

## Application Layer Protocols

Application layer protocols are used at the application layer of both OSI and TCP/IP models. They establish rules and standards for communication between applications, allowing quick and effective data sharing over networks.

### 1. **TELNET**
   - **Description**: TELetype NETwork protocol for terminal emulation. It allows clients to access resources on a Telnet server, often used for managing files or device setup.
   - **Port**: 23
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     telnet [RemoteServer]
     ```

### 2. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Transfers files between machines. It’s both a protocol and a program, promoting file sharing via remote computers.
   - **Port**: 20 (data), 21 (control)
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     ftp machinename
     ```

### 3. **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**
   - **Description**: A simplified version of FTP, suitable for transferring files between network devices.
   - **Port**: 69
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     tftp [options...] [host [port]] [-c command]
     ```

### 4. **NFS (Network File System)**
   - **Description**: Allows remote hosts to mount filesystems over a network as though they are local, aiding in centralized resource management.
   - **Port**: 2049
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     service nfs start
     ```

### 5. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Uses “store and forward” to move emails across networks. Works with the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to route communications.
   - **Port**: 25
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     MAIL FROM:<mail@abc.com>
     ```

### 6. **LPD (Line Printer Daemon)**
   - **Description**: Manages print requests for printers on a network.
   - **Port**: 515
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     lpd [-d] [-l] [-D DebugOutputFile]
     ```

### 7. **X Window**
   - **Description**: Protocol for GUI-based client/server applications, often used in mainframe networks.
   - **Port**: 6000 and up
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     Run xdm in runlevel 5
     ```

### 8. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Gathers network device data and allows administrators to manage network resources.
   - **Port**: 161 (TCP), 162 (UDP)
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     snmpget -mALL -v1 -cpublic snmp_agent_Ip_address sysName.0
     ```

### 9. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - **Description**: Translates domain names into IP addresses.
   - **Port**: 53
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     ipconfig /flushdns
     ```

### 10. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.
   - **Port**: 67, 68
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     clear ip dhcp binding {address | *}
     ```

### 11. **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)**
   - **Description**: Accesses data from the World Wide Web. HTTPS is a secure version.
   - **Port**: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

### 12. **POP (Post Office Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Retrieves emails from mail servers. The latest version is POP3.
   - **Port**: 110
   - **Modes**:
     - **Delete Mode**: Deletes messages from the server after download.
     - **Keep Mode**: Keeps messages on the server for future access.

### 13. **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)**
   - **Description**: Text-based chat system supporting file and data sharing within chats.
   - **Port**: 6667
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     Connect to IRC server
     ```

### 14. **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension)**
   - **Description**: Extends SMTP, allowing non-ASCII data (like audio, video, etc.) to be sent.
   - **Note**: MIME works with SMTP and is not a standalone protocol.
