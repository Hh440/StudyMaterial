The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more flexible, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and provide guidelines to make code more understandable and easier to modify.

Here’s what each principle stands for:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
Explanation: Each class should be focused on a single task or functionality. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes difficult to maintain and test, as changes to one responsibility could affect others.
Example: If you have a Report class that both formats the report and sends it via email, it's better to separate these responsibilities into different classes, such as ReportFormatter and EmailSender.
2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Definition: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Explanation: You should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code. This can often be achieved using polymorphism, abstract classes, or interfaces.
Example: If you have a Shape class and want to add new shapes (like Circle and Rectangle), you can extend the Shape class instead of modifying it directly. This helps avoid breaking the existing code.
3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Explanation: This principle ensures that a subclass can replace its superclass without unexpected behavior. Subclasses should follow the same rules as the parent class to prevent violating client expectations.
Example: If you have a Bird class with a fly method, a Penguin subclass (which can't fly) would violate LSP if it inherited fly. Instead, you might consider creating a FlyingBird class for flying birds, allowing Penguin to inherit a more appropriate superclass.
4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Definition: A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use.
Explanation: Interfaces should be specific to the client's needs, meaning that classes should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods. This prevents "fat" interfaces with methods unrelated to a class’s purpose.
Example: If you have a Worker interface with methods work() and eat(), it would be better to split them into separate Workable and Eatable interfaces, allowing clients to implement only what they need.
5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
Explanation: This principle encourages dependency on interfaces or abstract classes rather than on concrete classes, allowing for easier code changes and testing.
Example: If a WeatherApp class depends on a WeatherAPIService for data, it’s better to have WeatherApp depend on an interface like WeatherService and then let WeatherAPIService implement it. This way, you can easily swap WeatherAPIService with a different implementation if needed.
