# OSI Model

**OSI** stands for **Open System Interconnection**, which is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer. OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function. The OSI model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in 1984 and is now considered an architectural model for inter-computer communications.

The OSI model divides the entire communication task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task, and each layer is self-contained, meaning the task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.

## Characteristics of OSI Model

The OSI Model is divided into two parts: **upper layers** and **lower layers**.

- **Upper Layers**: The upper layer of the OSI model primarily deals with application-related issues and is implemented only in software. The **Application Layer** is closest to the end user. Both the end user and the Application Layer interact with software applications.
  
- **Lower Layers**: The lower layer of the OSI model addresses data transport issues. The **Data Link Layer** and the **Physical Layer** are implemented in both hardware and software. The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is closest to the physical medium, primarily responsible for placing information on the physical medium.

## 7 Layers of OSI Model

Below are the seven OSI layers, each with its specific functions:

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data-Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**
7. **Application Layer**
